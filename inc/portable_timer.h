/** A portable (between MS Windows and Unix) timer routine that yields microsecond resolution.
 
    Usage:
       - Declare an instance of portable_timer_t.
       - Start the timer using pt_start().
       - Stop the timer using pt_stop().
       - You can read the timer using pt_elapsed_us() or pt_elapsed_ms()
         regadless of whether the timer is running or not.
