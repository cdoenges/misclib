/** Logging facilities.

    A simple model is used for logging: there is a finite number of possible
    output channels, each of which uses a filter to limit what messages are
    reproduced by the channel.
    
    Each message carries a level of importance from very low (DEBUG) to high
    (FATAL). If the level of the message is equal to or higher than the filter
    level, the channel reproduces the message. Otherwise the message is
    suppressed.
