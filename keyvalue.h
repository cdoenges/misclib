/** Key-value encoded data storage.

    Each key-value object contains a number of keys with an attached value.

    The key is always a string in the current implementation. The value is
    a boolean, an integer, a floating-point number, a pointer, or a string.

    Note that this implementation could be improved in performance by choosing
    a different way of organizing the data, such as a hash table. This is
    currently not implemented.
